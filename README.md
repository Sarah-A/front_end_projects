# front_end_projects

This repository contains all the projects I've done while learning front end programing using:
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* ReactJS
* Redux

See subfolders for the different projects.

Each project has its own readme file or project instructions file for project I've submitted as part of Front End online courses.
