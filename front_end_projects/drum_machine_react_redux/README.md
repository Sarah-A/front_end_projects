# JavaScript and React Drum Machine
This project is one of the final projects in the Free Code Camp Front End Libraries Course.
In this project, I've created a simple drum-machine app using:
* HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery
* ReactJS, Redux 

## Requirements
For the complete instuctions for this project, see the [Project Instructions file](./project_instructions.txt) 
In addition to the requirements in the instructions document, I've implemented the followings:
* Made the application responsive using Bootstrap.
Note: due to time limitations, I built this application as a minimal viable product and didn't include any advanced features that were implemented in the example application but not included in the project's requirements.  

**NOTE**:
```
One of the project's requirements was to deploy it on CodePen. Therefore, I had to put all my code into one .js and one .css files. In order to workaround this issue, I've used comments in the code to show where it should be in a real project.  
```
